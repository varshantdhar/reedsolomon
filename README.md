# Reed-Solomon Implementation

gf256.c, gf256.h, gf256.o, rs255.c, rs255.h, rs255.o: Files I found here - http://www.corix.dk/Error-Correction/error-correction.html

I wrote test.c to find the error rate from the reed solomon interpretation and outputted the error rate values to a csv file: test.csv
Using R, I then drew out the graph for the Error Rate vs Length of String. An example is provided as well (graphs.png).
